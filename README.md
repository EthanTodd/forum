#Wee Living#

Taking the plunge and moving to NY from Chicago has afforded me many amazing experiences so far. However, one of the less exciting elements is learning how to downsize appropriately. This forum is a 'catch-all' for life hacks regarding urban living in small spaces.

I've called the forum 'Wee Living'.

The basic forum is contained in 11 categories that I thought were encompassing of the living situation. Within each category are the user provided threads. Each user also has the ability to comment (or reply) to any specific thread where they may have feedback to share.

This code was written in javascript and rendered with html and css. The data is saved using sqlite3 database in 3 seperate tables (interests, threads, replies). All of the code was pushed to github.

##The npm modules used were##
* express
* fs
* sqlite3
* body-parser
* method-override

##Future Updates##

For future updates I would like to add in geolocation, a user login, and fine tune the design. There are empty green boxes on the page where the logo for 'Wee Living' will go once it is designed.
